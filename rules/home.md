# Resilient RP Rulebook
## Built by the Players, for the Players
Resilient RP was created to give players something real: a city that feels alive, unpredictable, and shaped by the stories we build together.  
Every win, loss, and mistake should add to the experience, not take away from it.

This community thrives on creativity, fairness, and respect.  
We do not believe in punishing people for losing a shootout or a chase.  
We believe in rewarding great roleplay, collaboration, and effort.

Our staff team exists to **protect the experience**, not control it.  
We act when someone’s actions break immersion, harm others, or take away from the fun.  
The goal is simple: keep the world fair, immersive, and player-driven.

At its core, **Resilient RP is built by the players, for the players.**  
Every system, rule, and guideline exists to give you freedom, not limit it.

## Community Standards
### Respect and Conduct
- Treat everyone with respect, both in and out of character.  
- Discrimination, hate speech, or bigotry of any kind is never acceptable.  
  "It’s just RP" is **not** an excuse.  
- Harassment, stalking, threats, or targeted bullying on any platform will lead to removal.

### Off-Server Behavior
- What happens outside the city can still affect it.  
- Harassment, doxxing, or smear campaigns that create a hostile environment will be acted on.  
- We do not mediate personal disagreements, but we will protect player safety and trust.  
- Advertising other servers or communities within Resilient RP spaces is prohibited.

### Feedback and Accountability
- Honest feedback is welcome.  
- Personal attacks, public harassment, or targeted negativity are not.  
- Reports involving staff are reviewed independently to ensure fairness.

### Adult Community
- Resilient RP is **18+ only.**  
- Mature topics and conversations are fine, but harassment or explicit content are not.

### Appeals and Disputes
- If you are banned, you may appeal through our ticket system.  
- Appeals are handled by a staff member who was not involved in the original decision.

### Alternate Accounts and Ban Evasion
- Alternate accounts must be disclosed to staff.  
- Using alts to evade bans or spy on community spaces is a permanent ban.

### Naming and Profiles
- Character names, usernames, and profiles must follow community standards.  
- No impersonation, troll names, or sexual or offensive content.

### Leave Drama at the Door
- You do not have to like everyone, but you must act respectfully.  
- Persistent OOC drama, negativity, or toxicity will not be tolerated.


## Character Rules

- Characters must have realistic names and backstories that fit the world.  
- You may play multiple characters, but they **cannot** share information or resources.  
- Money, property, or items cannot be transferred between your characters or through third parties.  
- Avoid supernatural or unrealistic character concepts.  
- If a character is permanently killed, all associated assets and connections end with them.


## In-Game Conduct

### Roleplay First
- Stay in character at all times.  
- Every scene should add to the story and immersion.  
- If someone offers you roleplay, respond and engage.  
- Everyone shares responsibility for creating great scenes.

### In-Game Harassment
- Conflict is part of roleplay. Harassment is not.  
- Using RP to target someone out of character is unacceptable.  
- Harassment includes:
  - Repeatedly inserting into another player’s story without reason  
  - Using multiple characters to provoke or follow the same person  
  - Ignoring clear attempts to disengage or boundaries set by others  

### Breaking Character
- Do not break character mid-scene.  
- Avoid saying "RDM," "FailRP," or similar phrases in character.  
- Report issues afterward unless they involve hate speech or sexual content.

### Exploiting and Glitch Abuse
- Do not exploit bugs or mechanics. Report them immediately.  
- Examples include:
  - Duping money or items  
  - Abusing emotes or animations in combat  
  - Combat logging or disconnecting to avoid arrest or injury  
  - Using respawn to skip medical or police roleplay  
- Modifying your game to gain a combat advantage is not allowed, including recoil reduction, PvP sound packs, or visual alterations.

### Combat Logging
- Disconnecting, force-closing your game, or intentionally crashing to avoid RP or consequences is considered **combat logging**.  
- You must return to the server and resume the situation if it is still ongoing.  
- If you crash mid-scene, notify the involved players or staff immediately via Discord ticket or direct message.

### Value of Life (NVL)
- Act as if your character values their own life.  
- Ignoring armed threats or rushing death situations is NVL unless it is part of a permanent character decision.

### Metagaming
- Do not use out-of-character information in character.  
- This includes Discord calls, DMs, or live streams.  
- You may not be in any stream that is streaming Resilient RP while on the server.  
- You may not coordinate roleplay or crime through third-party applications while in the city.

### Stream Sniping
- Watching or interacting with live streams of players currently in the city is strictly prohibited.  
- You may not use, repeat, or act on any information gained from a live stream or VOD.  
- Being in a live stream chat while your character is in the server is considered metagaming.  
- Using Twitch clips or OOC chat logs to hunt or expose players is not permitted.
### Powergaming

Powergaming is when a player forces an outcome, removes another player’s ability to react, or performs actions that ignore realism and fair roleplay.  
It makes RP one-sided and breaks immersion by taking control away from others.

**Examples of Powergaming:**

- Using /me or /do commands to force success instead of describing an attempt.  
  - ❌ `/me knocks you out and steals your gun`  
  - ✅ `/me swings toward your head attempting to knock you down`
- Forcing another player into an action without giving them a chance to respond.  
- Refusing to acknowledge injuries, restraints, or realistic limitations (e.g., running after being shot multiple times).  
- Using unrealistic mechanics to gain an advantage (e.g., jumping or rolling to dodge bullets).  
- Looting or moving a player before any RP interaction or communication occurs.  
- Forcing someone to comply with actions through “one-line” RP (no conversation, no buildup).  
- Using emotes to bypass game systems or force combat advantages.  
- Robbing or kidnapping someone with zero RP or context (“hands up, give money” with no dialogue).  
- Forcing someone into permanent or major consequences (e.g., injury, loss of items, or death) without their consent or staff approval.  
- Forcing another player to break rules or act against their character.

**Not Powergaming:**

- A player suffering real in-character consequences from repeated choices or actions (e.g., betrayal, theft, retaliation).  
- Using clever in-character tactics, deception, or strategy as long as other players are given a fair chance to respond.  
- Taking initiative or acting decisively in-character when the situation makes sense.

Staff will review each case based on **intent, fairness, and RP quality**.  
If your actions remove another player’s ability to contribute meaningfully to the scene, it’s powergaming.

### Fail RP

Fail RP is any action that breaks immersion, ignores realism, or disregards logical roleplay behavior.  
Every player is responsible for keeping the world believable and consistent.

**Examples of Fail RP include:**

- Wearing troll, meme, or immersion-breaking outfits.  
- Using vehicles or props in unrealistic ways.  
- Speaking or acting out of character during roleplay scenes.  
- Refusing to respond to RP or ignoring police or civilian interactions without reason.  
- Claiming to have superpowers, invulnerability, or unrealistic knowledge.  
- Logging out or forcing a crash to avoid arrest, combat, or consequences.  
- Running back into a scene after respawning.  
- Talking about real servers, streamers, or OOC topics in character.  
- Ignoring fear, injury, or logic for convenience.  
- Using emotes or animations to avoid tasers, cuffs, or gunfire.  
- Creating or escalating fights with no RP reason.  
- Using medical or police roles to troll or stall RP.  
- Calling out "RDM," "VDM," or "FailRP" in character.  
- Pretending not to hear or see other players to avoid RP.

Staff will judge Fail RP based on **intent, pattern, and context**.  
If it breaks immersion or ruins RP for others, it counts.

### Random Deathmatching (RDM)
RDM means attacking, shooting, or killing another player without proper in-character reasoning or meaningful roleplay buildup.  
Every act of violence in the city must have clear context, escalation, and intent.

**Examples of RDM:**

- Killing someone because of a small argument or bump.  
- Shooting first without allowing the other party to respond.  
- Attacking players randomly in public with no story or reason.  
- Using robbery or hostage RP to justify unnecessary killing.  
- Retaliating for past events with no new interaction.  
- Ambushing players or police just to “create content.”

**Not RDM:**

- Defending yourself or others during clear, escalating RP.  
- Killing as part of a planned story, retaliation, or organized event with justification.  
- Responding to an active threat or someone who initiated violence.

If your gunfire replaces dialogue, it’s RDM.


### Vehicle Deathmatching (VDM)

VDM means using your vehicle as a weapon without RP justification or realistic intent.

**Examples of VDM:**

- Running players over intentionally without RP.  
- Using a car to kill during an argument.  
- Driving through crowds for fun.  
- Ramming another vehicle outside an active chase.  
- Using your car to gain combat advantage or prevent escape.  
- Using large vehicles to wipe out groups.

**Not VDM:**
- Accidental hits in a chase.  
- Light vehicle contact to block or push during RP.  
- Using a vehicle to escape danger realistically.

Intent and realism matter.  
If you’re using your car like a gun, it’s VDM.

### Copyrighted Music
- Avoid playing copyrighted songs in public areas to protect streamers.

### Server Events
- Do not interrupt or troll server-wide or staff-hosted events without prior approval.  
- This includes concerts, political events, funerals, or major storylines.  
- Events require significant staff effort - disruption without approval is Fail RP.

## Government and Allowlisted Roles

- Use your position responsibly and fairly.  
- Power without RP justification is Fail RP.  
- Police, EMS, and government employees must remain professional and consistent.   
- Sharing information between government and criminal roles is not allowed.  
- Selling or gifting government gear, weapons, or vehicles is prohibited.  
- Misuse of rank or permissions may result in removal or ban.

- Torture or extreme violence without consent is not allowed.

### Scamming and Theft RP
- Scams must be story-driven and have RP buildup.  
- Scamming new players or abusing mechanics for profit is prohibited.

This applies to any crime action that would trigger a large police response or a large-scale dynamic event.

**Prohibited during timer (examples):**
- Heists 
- High-tier boosts / organized car theft
- Large-scale armed robberies or shootouts
- Kidnappings / abductions that require coordinated police/EMS response

- Stay connected to in-city voice while playing.  
- Voice changers are allowed if clear and fitting for your character.

## Injury, Death, and Medical RP

- You may not recall events from the 30 minutes before your death.
